                <div class="accordion-body"><strong>VAR:</strong> <br>
                  Variables declared using var have function scope, meaning they are confined to the function in which they are declared and cannot be accessed outside of that specific function. <br>                  
                  <strong>LET:</strong> <br>
                  Variables declared with let are characterized by block scope, signifying that their accessibility is confined to the specific block in which they are defined. Blocks encompass various structures such as functions, loops, or any code enclosed within curly braces {}.<br>                  
                  <strong>CONST:</strong> <br>
                  Block Scope: Similar to `let`, `const` variables are block-scoped. <br>

                <div class="accordion-body"><strong>null:</strong> <br>
                  1.`null` null is a distinct value in JavaScript denoting a purposeful absence of any object or general value. It is frequently used to signify that a variable or property is intentionally devoid of an assigned value or has been intentionally cleared.<br>
                  2. It can function as a placeholder or an initial value, suggesting that it may be assigned a meaningful value later in the code.
                  <strong>undefined:</strong> <br>
                  Default Initialization: In JavaScript, when variables are declared without an assigned value, they are automatically initialized with undefined. As a result, undefined is commonly used as the default value for function parameters and variables. <br>
                  Property Retrieval: When attempting to access an object property that does not exist, the result is undefined. <br>
                  Array Elements: If an attempt is made to access an array element beyond the current length of the array, the result is undefined.<br>
                  Function Return: In cases where a function lacks an explicit return statement, it automatically returns undefined.</div>

                  A REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a set of guidelines and conventions that adhere to the principles of the REST architectural style. It serves as a mechanism for interacting with RESTful web services within the interconnected networks of the web. REST APIs facilitate communication between client-server applications by adhering to open protocols and standards for data exchange. Web services that align with the REST architecture and follow these principles are commonly referred to as RESTful web services.</div>
